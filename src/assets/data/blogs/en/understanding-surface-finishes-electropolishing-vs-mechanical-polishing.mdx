## Mechanical Polishing

Imagine sanding wood. You use grit to scratch the surface until it looks smooth.
*   **Microscope View**: Under a microscope, mechanical polish looks like a mountain range of peaks and folded metal. These folds trap bacteria.

## Electropolishing (EP)

EP is the reverse of plating. We put the steel in an acid bath and run electricity through it.
*   **Peak Removal**: The process dissolves the microscopic peaks of the metal first.
*   **Result**: A mathematically smooth surface. It also enriches the chromium oxide layer (passivation) by 500% compared to mechanical polishing.

## Conclusion

While Electropolishing (EP) creates a mathematically smooth surface, ALDR conducts a **professional, comprehensive evaluation** of every product's design to determine the safest finishing approach. The acid baths required for EP pose a critical risk for complex pharma furniture—such as double-clad designs—because liquids can become trapped inside the assembly, leading to hidden corrosion. 

For these complex geometries, ALDR primarily specifies **high-quality mechanical polishing (brushed) finishes** to achieve the required Ra and cleanability without structural risks. Electropolishing remains an excellent, validated option for simpler designs where geometry permits. Additionally, custom passivation is available upon request to further enhance surface passivity.
