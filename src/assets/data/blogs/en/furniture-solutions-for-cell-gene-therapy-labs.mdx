## The CGT Revolution

Cell and Gene Therapy (CGT) facilities operate differently than traditional pharma plants. They are often smaller, more modular, and handle smaller batch sizes—sometimes down to a single patient (autologous therapies).

At ALDR, we have adapted our furniture line to meet these agile needs.

### Flexible and Mobile

In a CGT suite, the process might change from month to month. Fixed, heavy furniture is a liability.
*   **Mobile Workstations**: Our **Cleanroom Computer Workstations** and tables are available with cleanroom-grade locking castors, allowing you to reconfigure your suite in minutes.
*   **Small Footprint**: We offer compact versions of our **Gowning Benches** and **Sinks** to fit into tight modular cleanroom panels (pods).

### Traceability

In autologous therapy, losing a sample means losing a patient's life.
*   **Dedicated Segregation**: Our **Mobile Storage Bins** come with color-coded tagging systems to physically segregate patient batches, preventing mix-ups.
