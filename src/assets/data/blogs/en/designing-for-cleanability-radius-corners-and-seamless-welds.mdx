## The Geometry of Hygiene

Bacteria are small. Cleaning tools (sponges, wipes) are large. If the geometry of the furniture is smaller than the cleaning tool, the bacteria win.

## The 90-Degree Problem

A sharp 90-degree internal corner is nearly impossible to clean perfectly. The wipe bridges the corner, missing the very vertex.
*   **The Solution**: Coved (Radius) Corners.
*   **The Spec**: All internal angles should have a minimum radius of 0.25" (6mm), often larger (20mm) for sink bowls. This allows the wipe to maintain continuous contact.

## Seamless Welds

Bolting two pieces of metal together creates a "Lap Joint." Liquid can wick between the layers via capillary action, creating a permanent reservoir for contamination.
*   **The Solution**: Continuous TIG welding. The two pieces become one. The weld is then ground smooth and polished to match the parent metal.

## Conclusion

Hygienic design costs more to fabricate (more welding, more polishing), but it pays for itself by reducing cleaning time and risk.
