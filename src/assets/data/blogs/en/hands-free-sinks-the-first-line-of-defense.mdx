## The Touch Contradiction

The purpose of washing hands is to remove bioburden. If you then touch a faucet handle to turn the water off, you have re-contaminated your clean hands. This is why "Hands-Free" is mandatory in GMP gowning.

## Activation Technologies

### 1. Infrared (IR) Sensor
*   **Pro**: Modern, sleek look.
*   **Con**: Can be finicky with black gloves. Requires batteries or power. Phantom activations can waste water.

### 2. Knee Valve (Mechanical)
*   **Pro**: 100% reliable. The operator leans their knee against a panel to flow water. No electricity needed. Infinite flow control (push harder for more pressure).
*   **Con**: Requires more under-sink space.

### 3. Foot Pedal
*   **Pro**: Simple.
*   **Con**: Makes cleaning the floor underneath the sink difficult (cleaning obstruction).

## The Verdict

For critical aseptic gowning, the **Knee Valve** remains the gold standard for reliability. There is no sensor to fail 10 minutes before a shift starts.

## Conclusion

The sink is the most used piece of equipment in the facility. Choose reliability over aesthetics.
