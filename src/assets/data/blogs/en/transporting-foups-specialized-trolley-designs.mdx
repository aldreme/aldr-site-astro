## The Million Dollar Cart

A Front Opening Unified Pod (FOUP) fully loaded with 25 processed wafers can represent millions of dollars in inventory value. Dropping it is not an option. Shaking it is also bad (particle generation).

## Design Features for Wafer Transport

1.  **Kinematic Coupling**: The cart shouldn't just have a flat shelf. It should have pins that mate with the bottom of the FOUP, locking it in place so it cannot slide off even if the cart hits a bump.
2.  **Shock Absorption**: Cleanroom floors have raised tile transitions. Transport trolleys need spring-loaded castors to dampen the impact of these bumps, preventing wafers from rattling in their slots.
3.  **Ergonomics**: 300mm FOUPs are heavy (approx 9kg). Carts should be at the exact transfer height for the loading ports (loadlocks) to minimize lifting strain.

## Conclusion

Logistics in a Fab is a critical process step. The "vehicle" (the cart) matters as much as the destination.
