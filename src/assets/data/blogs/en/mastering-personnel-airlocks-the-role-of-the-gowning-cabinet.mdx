## The Garment is the Filter

In a cleanroom, the human is the dirtiest thing. The Tyvek suit filter is the only thing protecting the product.
If that suit is stored on a wire shelf collecting dust before it is even worn, the protection is compromised.

## Vertical Laminar Flow Storage

For high-grade classifications (Grade B), garments should be stored in **HEPA-filtered cabinets**.
*   **Active Airflow**: A fan filter unit pushes clean air down over the hanging garments, washing away any particles.
*   **Hanging**: Garments should hang freely, not touching each other or the floor.

## Conclusion

Treat the gowning suit like a medical device. Store it sterile.
