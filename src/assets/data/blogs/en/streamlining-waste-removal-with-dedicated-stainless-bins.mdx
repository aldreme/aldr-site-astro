## The Dirty Bin

A waste bin is, by definition, full of trash. It is a biological risk.
*   **The Flaw**: Operators touching the lid.
*   **The Fix**: Foot-pedal operation is mandatory.

## Bag Retention

A common audit finding is the "bag skirt." This is the part of the plastic trash bag that hangs over the outside of the bin. This plastic collects dust and is hard to clean.
*   **Internal Ring**: Good GMP bins use an internal stainless steel ring to hold the bag *inside* the bin. The outside remains pure stainless steel.

## Conclusion

Even the trash can needs engineering.
