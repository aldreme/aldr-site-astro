## The Corrosion Myth

Facility managers often invest heavily in 316L stainless steel and assume it is maintenance-free. While the chromium oxide layer provides excellent protection, it is dynamic, not static. In the presence of chlorides (found in bleach) and lack of oxygen, this layer can bread down, leading to pitting.

## The 3 Rules of Longevity

### 1. Rinse, Rinse, Rinse
If you use sporicidal agents (hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide/peracetic acid blends), you are subjecting the steel to severe oxidative stress.
*   **Protocol**: Always follow a sporicidal clean with a WFI (Water for Injection) or 70% IPA rinse. Leaving "bleach residue" to dry on the surface is the #1 cause of premature rusting in the industry.

### 2. No Ferrous Contact
Never use carbon steel tools (wrenches, screwdrivers) on stainless furniture without protection. Microscopic iron particles transfer to the surface and become nucleation sites for rust.

### 3. Allow it to Breathe
Stainless steel needs oxygen to repair its passive layer. Leaving a wet rubber mat on a stainless table for weeks deprives the surface of oxygen, creating a crevice corrosion cell.

## Conclusion

With proper care, a 316L table will last 20 years. Treated poorly, it can rouge in 6 months.
