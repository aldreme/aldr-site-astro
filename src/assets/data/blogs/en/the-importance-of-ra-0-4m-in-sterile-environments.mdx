## Measuring Smoothness

How do you measure "smooth"? We use a profilometer to drag a diamond stylus across the metal.
**Ra (Roughness Average)** is the average height of the peaks and valleys.

## The 0.4 Micron Threshold

*   **Bacteria Size**: An average bacterium is 1-2 microns.
*   **The Trap**: If the surface roughness (scratch depth) is larger than the bacteria, the bacteria can hide in the scratch.
*   **The Goal**: Ra < 0.4µm ensures the surface features are smaller than the bacteria, meaning the bacteria stick out and can be wiped away easily.

## Conclusion

Ra is not just a number on a drawing; it is the physical limit of cleanability.
