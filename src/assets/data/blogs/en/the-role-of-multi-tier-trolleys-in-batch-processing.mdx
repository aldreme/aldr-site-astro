## The Conveyor Belt Substitute

In a flexible facility, you don't have conveyor belts. You have carts.
A well-designed trolley system acts as the "arteries" of the plant, moving components from warehouse to weighing to processing to filling.

## Stability and Noise

*   **Noise**: A rattling cart is annoying, but it also indicates vibration. Vibration creates particulates.
*   **Solution**: Polymer castors with precision bearings.
*   **Stability**: Multi-tier carts must be top-heavy stable. Using "lipped" shelves prevents bottles from sliding off during turns.

## Conclusion

Don't buy "kitchen carts" for a crypto-pharma plant. Invest in process carts engineered for stability and silence.
