## It's Steel, Not Indestructible

A common mindset among operators is that stainless steel is invincible. "It's metal, I can't hurt it." This leads to behaviors that damage the passive layer, create rust, and compromise sterility.

Effective Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) must address not just *how to clean*, but *how to use* facility assets.

## 3 Critical Behaviors to Train

### 1. No Abrasives (The "Green Pad" Rule)
Technicians trying to remove a stubborn stain often reach for a Scotch-Brite™ pad or steel wool.
*   **The Damage**: This instantly scratches the surface, destroying the Ra < 0.4µm finish. It creates deep grooves where bacteria will hide forever.
*   **The SOP**: "Only non-shedding polyester wipes or sponges are permitted. If a stain persists, report it to maintenance for chemical treatment (passivation)."

### 2. Weight Limits and Climbing
Operators often use the bottom shelf of a wire rack as a step ladder to reach high items.
*   **The Damage**: Wire shelves are not rated for point-loads of a human foot. They bend, welds crack, and they become hard to clean.
*   **The SOP**: "Do not climb on furniture. Use approved safety step-stools."

### 3. Door Integrity
Forcing a mechanical interlock on a pass-box (trying to open Door A while Door B is open) puts immense stress on the linkage rod.
*   **The Damage**: The internal rod bends. The interlock fails (either jamming shut or allowing both doors to open, breaking containment).
*   **The SOP**: "Verify the visual indicator (Green Light or mechanical flag) before attempting to open the door."

## Conclusion

Training staff to respect the infrastructure is as important as training them to run the bioreactor. A culture of care preserves the facility's qualified state and extends the lifespan of expensive capital assets.
