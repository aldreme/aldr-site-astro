## Minimalist Contact

How do you move dirty equipment parts (hoses, clamps, gaskets) to the autoclave?
*   **Solid Carts**: Bad. Pools water.
*   **Wire Carts**: Better. Drains water.

## The Validation Challenge

If the cart is also going into the washer/autoclave, the cart itself must be cleanable.
*   **Open Frame**: ALDR designs wash racks with minimal contact points. We use rod construction so the spray jets from the washer can hit 99% of the surface area of the parts being carried.
*   **Removable Sections**: If the rack is complex, it should disassemble so the rack itself can be verified clean during periodic qualification.

## Conclusion

The trolley is part of the cleaning cycle. It must be as open and drainable as possible.
