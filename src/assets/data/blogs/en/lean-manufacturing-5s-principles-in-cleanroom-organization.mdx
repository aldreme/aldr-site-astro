## Visual Management in the Lab

5S is a Lean Manufacturing methodology that originated in the automotive industry (Toyota), but it is perfectly adapted to contamination control. A disorganized lab is a dirty lab.

## The 5S Framework

1.  **Sort (Seiri)**: Remove unnecessary items. If a tool hasn't been used in a month, remove it from the Grade B zone. Every item is a surface to clean.
2.  **Set in Order (Seiton)**: "A place for everything."
    *   *Implementation*: Stainless steel shadow boards. Laser-etching the outline of a wrench ensures that if the wrench is missing, it is visually obvious immediately.
3.  **Shine (Seiso)**: Cleaning is inspection.
    *   *Implementation*: Properly finished furniture. Surfaces that are expertly evaluated for the right polish (brushed or electropolished) are easy to wipe (Shine), encouraging operators to keep them clean.
4.  **Standardize (Seiketsu)**: Consistency.
    *   *Implementation*: Color-coding. All "Cleaning" carts are Green; all "Waste" carts are Red. This reduces cognitive load and errors.
5.  **Sustain (Shitsuke)**: Discipline.
    *   *Implementation*: Audits and culture.

## Reducing Micro-Stops

In a cleanroom, searching for a pair of scissors isn't just annoying; it requires movement, which generates particles. 5S reduces motion, thereby reducing the particulate load on the HVAC system.

## Conclusion

5S is not about housekeeping; it is about process control. Well-organized furniture (shadow boards, labeled bins) is the hardware that makes the software (Lean culture) effective.
