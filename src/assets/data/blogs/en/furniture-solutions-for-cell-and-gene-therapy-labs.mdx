## The Agile Revolution

Cell and Gene Therapy (CGT) has fundamentally changed the operational tempo of biopharma. Unlike traditional monoclonal antibody production, which runs in large stainless steel bioreactors for weeks, CGT often involves small-batch, autologous (patient-specific) processing with rapid turnover.

Key Difference: **The need for reconfiguration.**
A suite processing viral vectors today might need to process cell expansion tomorrow.

## Modularity is Key

Fixed casework—heavy cabinets bolted to the wall—is becoming obsolete in these environments.
*   **Mobile Workstations**: The industry is shifting toward tables on locking, sanitary castors. This allows the room layout to be optimized for the specific process step (e.g., separating open vs. closed processing).
*   **Plug-and-Play Utilities**: Integrating power and gas drops into the ceiling (rather than the wall) allows furniture to be moved without disconnecting hard piping.

## Segregation Strategies

In autologous therapies, "mix-ups" are fatal. The infrastructure must support strict segregation.
*   **Color-Coded Transport**: Using specific trolley colors for specific patient cohorts is a simple visual control.
*   **Dedicated Kit Carts**: Instead of a central stockroom, "procedure carts" are pre-kitted with all consumables for a single patient batch and rolled into the suite, minimizing traffic in and out of the clean zone.

## Conclusion

Designing for CGT requires a mindset shift from "Capacity" to "Flexibility." The furniture is no longer just a table; it is a mobile tool that adapts to the science.
