## The Change Room Chaos

If a gowning room is disorganized, people will take shortcuts.
*   **Size sorting**: If mask sizes aren't labeled, people grab the wrong one, try it, discard it. Waste.

## Gravity Feed Dispensers

*   **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)**: Loading consumables from the top and dispensing from the bottom ensures stock rotation. Old gloves get used first.
*   **Visual Levels**: Acrylic fronts allow stockroom staff to see when levels are low without opening the dispenser (which introduces particles).

## Conclusion

A well-organized gowning room sets the psychological tone for the shift. "We are clean, we are organized, we are precise."
