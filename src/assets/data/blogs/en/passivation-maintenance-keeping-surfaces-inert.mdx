## What is Passivation?

Passivation is not a coating. It is a chemical treatment that removes "free iron" from the surface of stainless steel, leaving behind a surface that is richer in chromium. This chromium reacts with oxygen to form a passive film that resists corruption.

## Citric vs. Nitric Acid

For decades, Nitric Acid was the industry standard (ASTM A967).
*   **Nitric Pros**: Aggressive, effective.
*   **Nitric Cons**: Hazardous fumes, dangerous to handle, expensive disposal.

Today, **Citric Acid** is the preferred method for maintenance.
*   **Citric Pros**: Biodegradable, safe for operators (organic acid), and studies show it is equally effective at removing free iron.
*   **Application**: For facility maintenance, Citric Acid gels are ideal. They can be painted onto a vertical surface (like a tank wall or door frame), allowed to sit (dwell time), and then rinsed off, restoring the passive layer without shutting down the facility for a major intervention.

## Conclusion

Passivation isn't a "one and done" event at the factory. It is a lifecycle activity that extends the utility of your capital investment.
