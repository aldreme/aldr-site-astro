## The Clean/Dirty Paradox

The maintenance shop in a pharma facility is a paradox. It deals with greasy pumps and motors, yet it must remain "GMP Clean" to prevent dragging contamination back into the cleanroom during a repair.

## The Solution: Heavy-Duty Stainless

Most workshops use painted steel benches. Paint chips.
*   **The Upgrade**: 14-gauge 304 stainless steel.
*   **Why**: It is tough enough to handle a dropped wrench without denting, but it can be wiped down with solvent to remove grease, leaving a sterile surface. No paint to chip. No rust to form.

## Conclusion

Invest in stainless for the maintenance shop. It bridges the gap between the "dirty" mechanical world and the "clean" process world.
