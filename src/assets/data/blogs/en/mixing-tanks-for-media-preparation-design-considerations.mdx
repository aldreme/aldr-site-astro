## The Vortex Problem

If you put a center-mounted stirrer in a round tank, the liquid just spins. It creates a vortex. The powder floats on top, unmixed.
*   **Bad Design**: A round bucket with a propeller.
*   **Good Design**: A tank with baffles.

## Baffles: The Chaos Generators

Baffles are vertical plates welded to the tank wall. They disrupt the laminar rotational flow, converting it into chaotic turbulence. This turbulence pulls the floating powder down into the impeller zone and forces the liquid to turnover top-to-bottom.

## Surface Finish in Tanks

Because media fosters bacterial growth, the interior finish of a mixing tank is critical.
*   **Spec**: Ra < 0.4µm (Mechanically Polished, or Electropolished where the internal geometry allows based on design evaluation). Passivation available upon request.
*   **Reason**: Any scratch is a focal point for biofilm formation that can contaminate the entire batch.

## Conclusion

A mixing tank is a reactor. It must be engineered for fluid dynamics, not just volume.
