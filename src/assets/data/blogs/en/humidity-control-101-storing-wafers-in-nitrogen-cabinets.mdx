## The Water Molecule Enemy

In semiconductor manufacturing, Relative Humidity (RH) is a critical yield killer.
*   **Oxidation**: Copper interconnects oxidize rapidly in humid air.
*   **Stiction**: MEMS devices can fail due to capillary forces from water layers.
*   **Delamination**: Moisture absorbed by packaging materials expands during reflow soldering ("Popcorning").

## Why N2?

Nitrogen (N2) is the industry standard for dry storage because it is inert, abundant, and cheap.
*   **The Purge**: Storing wafers in a Nitrogen Desiccator cabinet actively displaces oxygen and moisture.
*   **Setpoint**: Typical specification is < 5% RH.

## Cabinet Design Features

It's not just a box with a seal.
*   **Plenum Chambers**: Top-tier cabinets use a rear plenum to distribute gas evenly. Without this, the top shelf might be 2% RH while the bottom shelf is 20% RH.
*   **Static Dissipative**: The glazing (windows) must be ESD safe (static dissipative acrylic) to prevent charge buildup on the cabinet itself.

## Conclusion

A desiccator is a yield-protection device. Ensure your cabinets are plumbed, purged, and monitored.
