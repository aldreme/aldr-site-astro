## The "Walk-Through"

Before an auditor checks your batch records, they often perform a facility walk-through. This visual inspection sets the tone. If the facility looks poorly maintained, the auditor assumes the documentation is also poor. Cleanroom furniture is high-visibility and often a source of findings.

Here are the top three "Red Flags" auditors look for in facility infrastructure.

## 1. Rust and Rouging

**The Finding**: "Visible corrosion on Grade B transfer cart."
**The Implication**: Rust is shedding iron oxide particles (contamination). It also indicates a failure of the passive layer, meaning the surface is no longer chemically cleanable.
*   **Prevention**: Ensure all 316L equipment is properly passivated. Avoid using chlorine-based cleaners on stainless steel without a thorough rinse.

## 2. Tape and "Temporary" Fixes

**The Finding**: "Adhesive tape residue on cabinet door."
**The Implication**: Tape is a harbor for bacteria and sheds particles. Using tape (or zip ties) to hold a door shut or secure a cable suggests that the equipment is broken or poorly designed.
*   **Prevention**: Maintain equipment latches. Use equipment with integrated cable management (sanitary chases) rather than makeshift solutions.

## 3. Damaged Wheels and Castors

**The Finding**: "Particulate shedding from trolley castors."
**The Implication**: Wheels are dynamic parts that grind against the floor. If the bearings are exposed or the tire material is degrading, they become mobile contamination generators.
*   **Prevention**: Use stainless steel or polymer housing castors. Inspect wheels monthly for cuts or flat spots.

## Conclusion

Audit readiness is a state of mind, not a last-minute scramble. By procuring high-quality, durable infrastructure and maintaining it proactively, you ensure that the "Walk-Through" builds confidence rather than suspicion.
