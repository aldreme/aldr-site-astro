## The Gowned Operator

Working in a tycoon suit for 8 hours is physically taxing. Heat retention, restricted movement, and double gloves all contribute to fatigue. When an operator is tired, they make mistakes. In a GMP environment, a mistake is a deviation.

## Adjustable Height Solutions

Standard 900mm tables are one-size-fits-none.
*   **Sit/Stand**: Hydraulic or electric lift tables allow operators to shift posture throughout the week.
*   **The Benefit**: Changing position improves circulation and focus.

## Reach Distances

In a Biosafety Cabinet or Laminar Flow Hood, reaching too far blocks the airflow return.
*   **Design**: Furniture should be designed "around the reach." Keep critical process steps within the "Product Zone" (approx. 12 inches from the front sash) to prevent ergonomic strain and airflow disruption.

## Conclusion

Ergonomics is not just about comfort; it is about error prevention.
