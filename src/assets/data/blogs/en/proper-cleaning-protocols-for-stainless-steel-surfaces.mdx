## It's Not Just Water

Cleaning a cleanroom requires a rotation of agents.
1.  **Detergent**: Removes the soil (dirt, grease).
2.  **Disinfectant (Phenolic/Quat)**: Kills the bacteria (vegetative).
3.  **Sporicide**: Kills the spores.

## The Rinse Step

The most forgotten step is the rinse.
*   **Residue**: Detergents leave sticky residues. Sporicides leave corrosive salts.
*   **WFI Rinse**: Always finish with Water For Injection or 70% Alcohol to remove chemcial residues.

## Wiping Technique

*   **Linear Motion**: Wipe in overlapping parallel lines.
*   **Never Circular**: Circular wiping just spreads the dirt around. The "S" curve moves contamination from clean to dirty.

## Conclusion

The tool (the furniture) is only as good as the operator maintaining it.
