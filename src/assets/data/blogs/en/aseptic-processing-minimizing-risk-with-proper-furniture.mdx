## The Prime Directive: First Air

In aseptic processing (ISO 5 / Grade A), the most critical rule is protecting **First Air**. Unidirectional HEPA air must reach the open product without interruption.

Furniture creates obstructions. Therefore, furniture must be designed to be "invisible" to the airflow.

## Rod Tops vs. Solid Tops

A solid stainless steel table acts as an air dam. It creates a zone of turbulence underneath it and a dead zone on top of it.
*   **The Solution**: Rod-top tables (or perforated tops).
*   **The Physics**: Air passes *through* the table surface. This maintains laminar flow velocity and washes particles away from the process, rather than letting them settle on the table.

## Minimalist Interactions

The best furniture in a Grade A zone is *no* furniture. If it must be there, it should be:
*   **Legless**: Wall-mounted cantilevers allow easier floor mopping.
*   **Featureless**: No drawers, no shelves, no hidden surfaces.

## Conclusion

In the aseptic core, form must follow function. The function is airflow.
