## The Real Estate Cost

Cleanroom floor space costs upwards of $2,000 per sq ft to build. Wasting 5 square feet because a standard rectangular table doesn't fit around a column is expensive inefficiency.

## The Power of Custom

Custom fabrication allows you to reclaim that space.
*   **Notched Tables**: Wrapping a table around a structural column.
*   **Angled Gowning Benches**: Maximizing space in a small airlock by following the wall geometry.

## Conclusion

Custom furniture is not a luxury; it is a space-saving strategy. The ROI on reclaiming usable square footage in a Grade A/B zone is immediate.
