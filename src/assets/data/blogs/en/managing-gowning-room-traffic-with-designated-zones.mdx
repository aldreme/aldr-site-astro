## The Line of Demarcation

The Personnel Airlock (PAL) is the busiest room in the facility. It is also where the highest particulate shedding occurs (people moving, changing clothes).

Effective PAL design relies on "The Bench" as a physical barrier.

## The Step-Over Concept

Top-tier facilities use a "Step-Over" bench (or "Sit-Over" bench) that spans the entire width of the room.
1.  **Dirty Side**: Operator enters, sits on the bench.
2.  **The Swing**: While seated, they lift their legs, swinging them over the bench to the clean side.
3.  **Clean Side**: They put on sterile boots (which are stored on the clean side) without their feet ever touching the floor.
4.  **Stand**: They stand up on the clean floor.

## Furniture as Process

By conducting the shoe change *on the bench*, we ensure that dirty street shoes never touch the clean floor, and sterile booties never touch the dirty floor. The bench isn't just a seat; it is a process control gate.

## Conclusion

Furniture placement dictates human behavior. Use your gowning benches to force compliance to the flow.
