## Electronics vs. Disinfectants

Paperless validation systems (e.g., MES, LIMS) mean computers are everywhere in the cleanroom. But standard PCs are vented cooling fans that suck in dust and cannot survive a spray-down.

Protecting these assets requires understanding **IEC 60529 (IP Ratings)**.

## Decoding the Code

An IP rating consists of two digits (e.g., IP65).

### First Digit: Solids (Dust)
*   **5**: Dust protected.
*   **6**: Dust tight (No ingress of dust). *Required for cleanrooms.*

### Second Digit: Liquids (Water)
*   **4**: Splashing water.
*   **5**: Water jets (low pressure).
*   **6**: Powerful water jets.

## The Recommendation: IP65

For most general GMP areas, **IP65** is the target.
*   It protects the computer from the cleaning crew spraying it with disinfectant.
*   It protects the cleanroom from the computer's fan blowing particulates out.

## Seals and Gaskets

The weak point is always the cable entry.
*   **Roxtec™ Style Seals**: Compressing rubber blocks around cables is the industry standard for maintaining the IP rating where power and ethernet cables enter the stainless steel enclosure.

## Conclusion

Don't wrap a PC in plastic wrap. Invest in properly engineered stainless steel enclosures with verified IP65 ratings to ensure data integrity and hardware survival.
