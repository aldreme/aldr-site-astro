## The Magic Ingredient: Molybdenum

304 Stainless is Iron, Chromium, and Nickel.
316 Stainless adds 2-3% **Molybdenum**.

This small addition changes the crystal structure of the steel, making it vastly more resistant to **Chlorides** (salts). Since biopharma uses saline solutions and bleach (chlorine) constantly, 304 steel would pit and rust in months.

## The "L" Factor

What is the "L"? It stands for **Low Carbon**.
*   **Carbon < 0.03%**
*   **Why?**: When you weld steel, high carbon precipitates out as carbides, weakening the weld area (Sensitization). 316L allows for welding without losing corrosion resistance.

## Conclusion

316L is not an upsell; it is a chemical necessity for the pharmaceutical environment.
