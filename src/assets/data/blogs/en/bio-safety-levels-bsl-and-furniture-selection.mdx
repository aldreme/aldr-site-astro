## Keeping the Bug In

In a GMP cleanroom, we protect the product from the human. In a BSL (Bio-Safety Level) lab, we protect the human from the pathogen.
*   **BSL-3**: TB, SARS-CoV-2.
*   **BSL-4**: Ebola, Marburg.

## Decontamination Resilience

High containment labs are subjected to brutal decon cycles, often gas fumigation (Formaldehyde or Chlorine Dioxide).
*   **Material**: 304 stainless will corrode efficiently under these gases. **316L** is mandatory.
*   **Sealing**: Hollow gaps in furniture legs are unacceptable. If gas gets in, it might leak out later. All tubular furniture must be hermetically welded and verified leak-tight.

## Waste Handling

Everything that leaves a BSL-3 lab must be autoclaved.
*   **Autoclavable Carts**: Furniture must be designed to fit *inside* the pass-through autoclave. It must withstand 121°C temperatures and vacuum cycles without warping or wheel failure.

## Conclusion

In high containment, furniture integrity is a matter of life safety.
