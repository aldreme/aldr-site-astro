## The Spirit of the Law

cGMP (Current Good Manufacturing Practice) is not a prescriptive checklist of table dimensions. It is a philosophy of Quality, Safety, and Efficacy.
*   **Quality**: The product must be consistently produced.
*   **Safety**: The environment must not contaminate the product.

## 3 Pillars of GMP Furniture

1.  **Cleanable**: The surface must be impervious. It must withstand daily disinfection without degrading (rusting), which would create a contamination risk.
2.  **Durable**: It should not break during normal use. A broken castor can tip a cart, spilling a batch.
3.  **Traceable**: If a recall occurs, can you prove the table didn't cause it? (See our article on Mill Certs).

## Conclusion

When buying furniture for a GMP zone, ask: "Does this support the quality of the drug?" If the answer is "It's just a table," look closer.
