## Moving Parts Create Dust

Tribology is the study of friction and wear. In a cleanroom, wear = dust.
*   **Chrome Plating**: When two chrome wires rub together (like on a wire shelf clip), the plating flakes off. These flakes are metallic particles.
*   **Aluminum**: Anodized aluminum is good, but if scratched, raw aluminum oxidizes and sheds.

## The Stainless Solution

Stainless steel is a homogeneous material. It does not have a coating to flake off. Even if it rubs, it creates stainless steel dust (which is heavy and falls), not light chemical flakes that float.

## Conclusion

For dynamic applications (carts, spinning chairs), material selection is critical to maintaining ISO counts.
