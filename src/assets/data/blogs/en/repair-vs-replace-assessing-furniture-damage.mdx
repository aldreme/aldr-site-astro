## The Damage Assessment Matrix

When a cart crashes into a doorframe or a heavy valve drops on a table, you have a decision to make. Is the damage cosmetic, or is it a compliance risk?

## Category A: Surface Scratches
Light scratches that do not catch a fingernail (depth < 0.1mm).
*   **Risk**: Low.
*   **Action**: **Repair**. These can typically be buffed out using a non-woven abrasive pad (in the direction of the grain) and re-passivated with a citric acid gel in-situ.

## Category B: Deep Gouges
Scratches that catch a fingernail or expose base metal.
*   **Risk**: High. Deep grooves harbor bacteria and protect them from cleaning agents.
*   **Action**: **Refurbish or Replace**. This requires welding (adding filler material) and mechanical polishing. It usually cannot be done in the cleanroom due to particulate generation.

## Category C: Structural Deformation
Bent legs, cracked welds, or warped doors.
*   **Risk**: Critical. A cracked weld is a "hollow" that can collect fluids.
*   **Action**: **Replace**. Attempting to bend steel back often fatigues the metal, leading to future failure.

## Conclusion

Don't ignore the "small stuff." A deep scratch on a prep table is a 24/7 contamination risk.
