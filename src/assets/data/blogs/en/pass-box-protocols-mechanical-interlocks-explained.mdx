## The Hole in the Wall

A Pass Box (or Pass-Through) is essentially a hole in your cleanroom containment. If both doors open simultaneously, the pressure differential collapses, and air from the "dirty" side rushes into the "clean" side.

## The Interlock

To prevent this, an interlock system is mandatory. But which type?

### Electronic/Magnetic
*   **Mechanism**: Solenoids lock the opposing door.
*   **Risk**: If power fails, does it fail locked (trapping material) or unlocked (breaching containment)? Electronic systems add wiring complexity inside the wall.

### Mechanical
*   **Mechanism**: A solid steel rod connects the two door mechanisms. Opening Door A physically rotates a cam that jams Door B shut.
*   **Benefit**: Zero fail rate. No electricity required. Maintenance-free for years.

## Conclusion

For standard material transfer, the robust simplicity of a mechanical interlock is often superior to complex electronic systems. It essentially "poka-yokes" (mistake-proofs) the transfer process.
