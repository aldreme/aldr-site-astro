## The Cost of Air

Cleanroom classifications (ISO 7, ISO 5) are expensive to maintain. The HVAC cost per cubic foot is high. Therefore, dedicating large footprints to static shelving aisles is an inefficient use of capital.

High-density mobile shelving (compactors) can reduce the storage footprint by 50%, but implementing them in a clean environment requires specific engineering features.

## The Track Problem

Standard office mobile shelving uses floor tracks that are bolted down, creating rails that trip operators and trap dirt.
*   **Cleanroom Solution**: Flush-mounted tracks. The stainless steel rail is embedded into the epoxy or vinyl floor, creating a perfectly smooth threshold. This allows carts to roll over them and mops to clean across them without obstruction.

## Airflow and Particulates

Moving shelves create friction.
*   **Guidance Systems**: Instead of metal-on-metal wheel flanges, cleanroom systems use side-guide rollers made of non-shedding polymers (like Delrin or UHMWPE) to prevent particulate generation during movement.
*   **Venting**: Shelves are typically wire or perforated to allow vertical airflow, preventing stagnant pockets of air where humidity could accumulate.

## Conclusion

Dense storage is necessary for supply chain efficiency, but it cannot come at the cost of cleanliness. Flush tracks and non-shedding guidance systems bridge this gap.
