## Unidirectional Flow

In ISO 5 zones, air moves from the ceiling to the floor in straight lines.
*   **The Blockage**: A solid shelf acts as an umbrella. It protects the items underneath it from the clean air.

## The Perforated Solution

*   **Wire Shelving**: almost 90% open area. Excellent for airflow. Harder to clean (wires are round).
*   **Perforated Sheet**: Laser-cut holes in a flat sheet. approx 40-50% open area. Easier to wipe than wire, but still allows air passage.

## Application

Use wire for storage (warehouse, ambient). Use perforated tops for process tables where liquid spills might occur (cleanability) but airflow is still needed.

## Conclusion

Visualize the air. If the furniture blocks the air, the furniture is dealing with contamination, not preventing it.
