## The Last Mile Problem

You store your vaccine at -80°C. You fill it at room temperature. The movement between the freezer farm and the filling line is a risk point.

## Transport Solutions

### 1. Active Cooling
*   **Battery Powered**: Carts with built-in refrigeration units.
*   **Con**: Heavy, expensive maintenance, battery life anxiety.

### 2. Passive Thermal Mass (The Robust Choice)
*   **PCM**: Using Phase Change Materials (like frozen gel packs) or massive stainless steel blocks pre-chilled to temp.
*   **Insulation**: Double-walled, vacuum-insulated transfer carts.
*   **Pro**: Failsafe. A block of steel doesn't have a circuit board that breaks.

## Validation

Whatever method is chosen, the cart must be thermally mapped. Sensors are placed in corners and center to prove that the temperature holds within spec (e.g., 2°C - 8°C) for the duration of the transfer window.

## Conclusion

Transport adds variables. Passive thermal protection reduces those variables.
