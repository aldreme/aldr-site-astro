## "Show Me the MTR"

During a facility audit, an inspector might point to a tank and ask, "Prove to me that this is 316L stainless steel."

If you cannot produce the **Mill Test Report (MTR)**, that tank is now a mystery metal. It is a finding.

## The Chain of Custody

Traceability works like this:
1.  **The Foundry**: Casts the steel heat. Issues an MTR with chemical analysis (Heat #12345).
2.  **The Master Coil**: The steel coil is tagged with Heat #12345.
3.  **Fabrication**: We cut sheets from the coil. We etch the heat number onto the finished product (often hidden under a leg or lip).
4.  **The Turnover Package**: When you buy the table, you receive a digital packet linking Serial #XYZ to Heat #12345.

## Conclusion

ALDR maintains digital records for 10+ years. We sell audit insurance, not just furniture.
