## Why Smoothness Matters

In the cleanroom industry, you will often see the specification "**Ra &lt; 0.4µm**" (or roughly 15 micro-inches) on drawings for stainless steel equipment. It is significantly more expensive to produce than a standard "brushed" finish. So, is it worth it?

The answer lies in the relative size of bacteria versus steel imperfections.

## The Scale of the Problem

*   **Bacteria Size**: Common contaminants like *Staphylococcus aureus* or *E. coli* are typically **0.5µm to 2.0µm** in diameter.
*   **Standard Steel Finish (No. 4)**: A mechanical brush finish typically has an Ra (Roughness Average) of **0.8µm to 1.2µm**.

If you look at a cross-section of a No. 4 finish under a microscope, it looks like a series of mountain peaks and valleys. The "valleys" are often deep enough to fully hide a bacterial cell. When a cleaning wipe passes over the "peaks," it bridges the gap, leaving the bacteria in the valley untouched.

## Electropolishing: Reducing the Habitat

Electropolishing (EP) is an electrochemical process that removes surface material. Crucially, it removes material from the "peaks" faster than the "valleys," effectively flattening the landscape.
*   **Result**: An EP surface typically achieves **Ra &lt; 0.4µm**.
*   **Benefit**: The "valleys" are now much shallower—too shallow for a bacterium to hide in. The cleaning wipe makes contact with the entire surface, and the bacteria are physically removed.

**However, ALDR carefully inspects the design to determine the most appropriate polish approach.** While EP achieves excellent smoothness, it cannot be safely applied to all geometries due to liquid entrapment risks in complex assemblies. Advanced, controlled mechanical brushing can achieve the necessary smoothness for these complex assemblies safely. EP is used when the product design permits, and passivation is manually applied to enhance chemical passivity when required.

## Chemical Passivity

Beyond geometry, electropolishing changes the chemistry. It removes surface iron and enriches the chromium/nickel ratio.
*   **Hydrophobicity**: The resulting surface is often more hydrophobic (water-repelling).
*   **Adhesion**: A smoother, passive surface has lower surface energy, meaning bacteria have a harder time physically attaching (adhering) to the steel in the first place.

## Conclusion

The "Ra" value is not just a number on a spec sheet; it is a direct proxy for biological risk. Investing in lower surface roughness is investing in the efficacy of your cleaning program.
