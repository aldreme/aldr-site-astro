## The Cost of a Door Opening

Every time a person walks through a door, the pressure differential fluctuates and turbulence is created.
Every time a person gowns up to bring in a box of pens, 15 minutes of labor is lost.

## The Pass Box Solution

A Static Pass Box is a simple, interlocked chamber mounted in the wall.
*   **Protocol**: Open dirty side -> Place item -> Close dirty side -> Wait (dwell time) -> Open clean side.
*   **Result**: The person stays outside. The item goes inside.

## Conclusion

Material transfer should not require personnel transfer.
