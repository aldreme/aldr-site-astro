## The Microgram Threshold

As drug discovery moves toward highly targeted oncology therapies and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), the potency of the molecules increases. An Occupational Exposure Limit (OEL) in the nanogram range means that an invisible speck of dust can be toxic to the operator.

While primary containment (Isolators, Split Butterfly Valves) is the first line of defense, the secondary barrier—the furniture and room surfaces—plays a critical safety role.

## Surface Porosity and Decontamination

If a spill occurs, can you clean it?
*   **The Risk**: Standard 304 stainless steel or, worse, phenotypic resin (lab countertops) can have microscopic porosity. A potent powder can migrate *into* the material, making 100% decontamination impossible.
*   **The Mitigation**: Appropriately finished stainless steel—whether high-quality brushed (with optional passivation) or Electropolished (for allowable designs)—creates the required passive, sealed surface for decontamination. The choice is driven by a comprehensive design inspection by ALDR to prevent liquid entrapment in complex assemblies.

## Design for Decon

Equipment in HPAPI zones must withstand harsh inactivation agents.
*   **Fogging Compatibility**: Facilities often use Vaporized Hydrogen Peroxide (VHP) for room decontamination. Furniture materials (including castor tires and gasket seals) must be verified clear of oxidative checking or degradation after repeated VHP exposure.
*   **Seamless Construction**: A table with a bolted cross-member creates a crevice where powder can accumulate. Fully welded, seamless frames eliminate these "reservoirs" of toxicity.

## Conclusion

In HPAPI manufacturing, safety is systemic. From the isolator to the gowning bench, every surface must be chosen for its ability to be validated "clean" after a potential breach.
