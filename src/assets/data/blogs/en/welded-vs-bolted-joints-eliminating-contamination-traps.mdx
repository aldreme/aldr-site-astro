## The Lap Joint

When you bolt two pieces of metal together, you create a microscopic gap between them.
*   **Capillary Action**: Water, cleaning fluids, and product will be sucked into this gap.
*   **Corrosion**: This trapped fluid becomes stagnant, leading to crevice corrosion.
*   **Growth**: Bacteria thrive in these wet, dark gaps.

## The Sanitary Weld

Cleanroom furniture should be **Fully Welded**.
*   **Sealed**: The joint is fused with TIG welding.
*   **Ground**: The weld bead is ground down flush.
*   **Polished**: The area is polished to match the parent metal.

## Conclusion

Bolts shake loose. Welds are forever. In a critical environment, permanence effectively equals safety.
