## The Ugly Bowl

We've all seen them: the yellow plastic bowls bolted to the wall, collecting dust. In a cleanroom, these are particulate traps. Yet, safety regulations (ANSI Z358.1) mandate emergency eye wash stations within 10 seconds of hazardous materials.

## Integrated Solutions

The modern approach is to integrate the eye wash directly into the sink deck.
*   **Swing-Over Units**: The eyewash faucet sits behind the sink. In an emergency, pulling it forward activates the flow.
*   **Pull-Down Units**: Recessed into the wall or backsplash. Pulling the tray down activates the water.

## Drainage Benefits

A major issue with wall-mounted units is testing. Weekly activation checks often splash water onto the floor, creating slip hazards and potential mold growth.
*   **Sink-Integrated**: The water flows directly into the sink drain. Testing takes 5 seconds and leaves no mess.

## Conclusion

Safety equipment should be intuitive and unobtrusive. By hiding the eye wash in plain sight (at the sink), you ensure it is accessible without cluttering the cleanroom wall space.
