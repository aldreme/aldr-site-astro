## The Ledge Problem

Every horizontal surface is a dust collector. A computer monitor sitting on a desk creates a ledge. The desk itself is a ledge.

## Flush Mounting

The ultimate hygienic solution is to bury the technology into the wall.
*   **The Design**: A stainless steel bezel seals the monitor against the pharmaceutical panel wall.
*   **The Benefit**: Zero horizontal surface. The screen becomes part of the wall, wipeable in a single motion.

## Challenges

Heat dissipation is the challenge. The PC behind the wall needs ventilation into the "technical space" (gray space) behind the cleanroom, not into the cleanroom itself.

## Conclusion

Recessed integration costs more during construction but pays back in reduced cleaning time every single day.
