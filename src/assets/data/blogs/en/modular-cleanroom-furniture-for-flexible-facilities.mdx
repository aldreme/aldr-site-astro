## The "Ballroom" Concept

Historically, biopharma facilities were a maze of small, fixed rooms (suites), each dedicated to one unit operation. The modern trend is the "Ballroom"—large, open Grade C backgrounds where Grade A is achieved inside closed systems (single-use bioreactors, isolators).

This openness requires furniture that breaks the traditional mold.

## Connectivity and Ganging

In a Ballroom, a process line might be 10 meters long today and split into two 5-meter lines next month.
*   **Ganging Systems**: Worktables are designed with quick-connect latches, allowing them to be physically joined to form seamless, long workbenches, and then separated without tools.
*   **Shared Utilities**: Systems where power strips and data lines daisy-chain from table to table reduce the need for excessive floor cables.

## Standardization

Customization is the enemy of flexibility. Large pharmas are establishing "Global Catalogs" of standard dimensions (e.g., all tables are 900mm high, all carts are 600mm wide). This standardization allows assets to be moved not just within a room, but between facilities globally without ergonomic or fit-out issues.

## Conclusion

The facility of the future is not a building; it is a platform. The furniture within it must be as modular and interchangeable as the Lego bricks of a toy set.
