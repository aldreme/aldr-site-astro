## The Co-Working Lab

Startups often share "incubator" lab space to save costs. Company A is working on a virus; Company B is working on a stem cell. They share a sink. The risk of cross-contamination is massive.

## Territorial Definition

Furniture guides behavior.
*   **Mobile Lab Benches**: Each tenant gets a "pod" on wheels. This creates a psychological and physical boundary. "This is *my* bench."
*   **Lockable Storage**: Shared fridges are chaos. Dedicated, lockable under-bench storage units ensure reagents don't get swapped or stolen.

## Cleaning Assurance

In a shared space, you don't know what the previous user spilled.
*   **Impervious Surfaces**: Porous surfaces (wood, laminate) hold ghosts of past experiments. 100% Stainless steel or phenolic resin allows a tenant to "reset" the hygiene of a workspace with a strong disinfectant before starting their work, with confidence that the surface is clean.

## Conclusion

Shared spaces shouldn't mean shared risks. Proper furniture selection provides the boundaries that protocols alone cannot enforce.
