## The Rust Never Sleeps

Copper, Silver, and even some grades of steel will oxidize in standard atmosphere (21% Oxygen, ~50% Humidity). For precision parts (mold dies, spare pump rotors), this surface corrosion can ruin tolerances.

## The Inert Atmosphere

A Nitrogen Cabinet replaces the air with N2.
*   **Relative Humidity**: Drives it down to < 1-5%.
*   **Oxygen**: Displaces O2.

## Cost Benefit

It is cheaper to run a trickle of Nitrogen gas than to replace a $50,000 mold tool that pitted while sitting on a shelf.

## Conclusion

Dry storage is a cheap insurance policy for expensive spare parts.
