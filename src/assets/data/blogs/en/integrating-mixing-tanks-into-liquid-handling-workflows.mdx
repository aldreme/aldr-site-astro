## The Bottleneck of Media Prep

In upstream processing, media preparation is often the most labor-intensive step. Powder must be weighed, transported, and hydrated. The design of the mixing vessel directly impacts the speed and safety of this operation.

## Ergonomic Design for Loading

Dumping 25kg bags of powder into a tank requires significant physical effort.
*   **Loading Height**: The top opening of the tank should ideally be at waist height (approx. 900-1000mm) to prevent shoulder injury. For larger tanks, integrated steps or platforms are safer than portable ladders.
*   **Bag Grates**: Examples of safety engineering include stainless steel grates across the opening. These support the heavy bag while the operator slits it open, preventing the bag (and its outer contamination) from falling into the media.

## Mixing Efficiency

It's not just a bucket with a stirrer.
*   **Vortex Breaking**: Without baffles, a mixer just spins the liquid in a circle. Welded baffles on the tank wall disrupt the flow, creating turbulence that pulls powder down into the liquid for rapid hydration.
*   **Dead Legs**: Drain valves must be flush-mounted (zero dead leg) to ensure that no unmixed powder or stagnant liquid remains in the valve throat during the process.

## Conclusion

Mixing tanks are process equipment. Their selection should be driven by a time-and-motion study of the operator's workflow to ensure both safety and solubility efficiency.
