## The Silent Killer of Chips

A human walking across a floor can generate 30,000 volts of static electricity. A MOSFET gate can be destroyed by 30 volts. In an electronics cleanroom, the furniture itself must be part of the grounding system to prevent this invisible damage.

## The Resistance Spectrum

Materials are classified by their surface resistance (Ohms/square):
*   **Insulative (> 10^12)**: Standard plastic/wood. Dangerous. Holds charge.
*   **Dissipative (10^5 - 10^11)**: The sweet spot. Drains charge slowly enough to prevent a spark but fast enough to prevent buildup.
*   **Conductive (< 10^5)**: Bare metal. Drains charge instantly (can be a shock hazard for operators).

## Grounding the Table

A stainless steel table is conductive, but it sits on rubber feet. It is an "isolated conductor," which is essentially a capacitor waiting to zap a chip.
*   **The Chain**: ESD tables must have a path to ground.
    1.  Conductive Castors (or drag chains).
    2.  Conductive Floor.
    3.  Facility Ground.

## Conclusion

ESD auditing shouldn't stop at the wrist strap. Your workbenches and carts must be part of the EPA (Electrostatic Protected Area).
