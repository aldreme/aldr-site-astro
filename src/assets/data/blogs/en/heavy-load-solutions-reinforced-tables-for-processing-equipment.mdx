## When a Table Needs to be a Platform

In a lab, a table holds pipettes and a laptop. In a pilot plant, a "table" might need to hold a 500kg chromatography column or a 200L buffer tank. Using standard lab furniture for these loads is a safety hazard.

## Sub-Top Reinforcement

A sheet of stainless steel (even thick 14-gauge) will bow under heavy point loads. To prevent this "drum skin" effect, heavy-duty tables utilize specific reinforcement:
*   **Hat Channels**: C-shaped steel channels welded to the underside of the top.
*   **Sound Deadening**: These channels are often bonded with automotive-grade acoustic mastic to dampen vibration and noise (the "gong" sound when you place an object down).

## Leg Geometry

Standard 1.5" tube legs are insufficient for process loads.
*   **Upgrade**: Heavy-duty tables typically move to 2" (50mm) square tubing.
*   **Cross-Bracing**: H-frame or U-frame bracing at the bottom of the legs prevents "splaying" (legs spreading outward) under heavy vertical loads.

## Conclusion

Always specify the "Live Load" when ordering process furniture. Over-engineering the structure costs a fraction more than a collapsed table costs in lost product and injury claims.
