## When the Floor Moves

Modern metrology (SEM, TEM, AFM) operates at the nanometer scale. At this magnification, a truck driving past the building or an HVAC compressor turning on creates enough vibration to blur the image.

## Mass vs. Isolation

Two strategies exist for stabilizing microscopes.

### 1. Mass Damping
*   **Technique**: Use a heavy slab (Granite or Optical Breadboard).
*   **Physics**: A large mass has high inertia; it resists movement. This dampens high-frequency noise (like voices or fans).

### 2. Pneumatic Isolation
*   **Technique**: Air legs ("Air Springs").
*   **Physics**: The table floats on a cushion of air. This effectively decouples the table from the floor, filtering out low-frequency noise (like building sway or foot traffic).

## Conclusion

Don't put a $500,000 microscope on a $500 table. The stability of the platform dictates the resolution of the data.
