## The Glass Bottle Risk

Moving 4L glass Winchester bottles of solvents (Acetone, IPA) is a high-risk activity. If a bottle drops, you have a spill, fumes, and glass shards.

## Secondary Containment

A chemical cart must act as a bund.
*   **The Sump**: The bottom shelf should be water-tight with a raised lip (at least 2 inches).
*   **Capacity**: It must hold 110% of the volume of the largest container.

## Material Compatibility

Stainless steel is great for solvents. It is bad for bleach or HCL. Know your chemical compatibility before buying the cart. For acids, use Polypropylene carts.

## Conclusion

The cart is your mobile safety net. Does it catch the fall?
