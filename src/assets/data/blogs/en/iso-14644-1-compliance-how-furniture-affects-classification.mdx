## The Particle Budget

ISO 14644-1 limits the number of particles allowed per cubic meter.
*   **ISO 5 (Grade A/B)**: < 3,520 particles (0.5µm).
*   **ISO 7 (Grade C)**: < 352,000 particles.

Your HVAC system fights to remove particles. Your furniture should not be adding to the fight.

## Generators vs. Neutrals

Every object in a cleanroom is either a particle **Generator** or a particle **Neutral**.
*   **Generators**: Painted steel (paint chips), chrome plating (flakes), wood (fibers), standard plastic (sheds).
*   **Neutrals**: Appropriately Finished Stainless Steel (Brushed or Electropolished based on design evaluation), Glass, specialized cleanroom polymers (PVDF, PTFE).

## The ALDR Standard

We design furniture to be ISO Neutral. By eliminating friction points (using polymer bushings in hinges) and using non-shedding materials, we ensure that the only particle generators in the room are the people.
